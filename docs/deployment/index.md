# Self-Hosting

You are encouraged to self-host an RSSerpent instance.

!!!note
    An instance is a running copy of the RSSerpent software.

<!-- Self-hosting is neither difficult nor complicated. You are not required to have any relevant experience in computer programming to achieve this job. Here are some easy-to-follow tutorials on self-hosting an RSSerpent instance:

- [[Deploy with Deta]](deta.md)
- [[Deploy with Heroku]](heroku.md)
- [[Deploy with Vercel]](vercel.md) -->

## Official Instances

RSSerpent has hosted some official instances. If you believe self-hosting is not a viable option for you, consider using one of the follows:

- <https://rsserpent.imciel.com>, hosted on [vultr.com](https://www.vultr.com/) [[source](https://github.com/RSSerpent-Rev/rsserpent-official)];
<!-- - <https://rsserpent.deta.dev>, hosted on [deta.sh](https://www.deta.sh/) [[source](https://github.com/RSSerpent-Rev/RSSerpent-deploy-deta)];
- <https://rsserpent.herokuapp.com>, hosted on [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) [[source](https://github.com/RSSerpent-Rev/RSSerpent-deploy-heroku)]; -->
