# Self-Hosting

You are encouraged to self-host an RSSerpent instance.

## Official Instances

- <https://www.rsserpent.com>, hosted on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) [[source](https://github.com/RSSerpent/rsserpent-deploy-vercel)];
- <https://deta.rsserpent.com>, hosted on [deta.sh](https://www.deta.sh/) [[source](https://github.com/RSSerpent/rsserpent-deploy-deta)];
