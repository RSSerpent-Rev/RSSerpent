# Deploy with Vercel

Learn to self-host an RSSerpent instance on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (for *free*) through this tutorial.

## Use the Template

Go to the RSSerpent Vercel deployment [template](https://github.com/RSSerpent-Rev/RSSerpent-deploy-vercel), then click the [![Template Button](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rsserpent/asset@latest/template-button.png)](https://github.com/RSSerpent-Rev/RSSerpent-deploy-vercel/generate) button. You will be prompted to create a repository based on the template.

## Deploy the Project

Open this [link](https://vercel.com/new) in your browser, click *Continue with GitHub*. Vercel will instruct you to authenticate with your GitHub account. After successful login, Vercel will ask you to import a GitHub repository to deploy. You will need to find the `rsserpent-deploy-vercel` repository that you just created, and then click the ![Vercel Import Repository Button](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rsserpent/asset@latest/vercel-import-repo-button.png) button to its right.

Now, Vercel will ask you to configure the project. The good news is you don't have to! Just click the *Deploy* button, wait for several minutes, and your RSSerpent instance will be online.

## Running ðŸŽ‰

If your interface now looks like this, congratulations, you are good to go! You can access your RSSerpent instance from the browser by clicking the website thumbnail in the center.
